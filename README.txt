This program is a letter counter that analyzes how many times each letter is used in a set of input files listed to it by a "subreddits" file.
The analyzer was built as part of an inquiry into whether and why different online communities exhibit different patterns in letter frequency.
This program's sister project is a program which downloads the top 100 posts from each Subreddit in a text file, "subreddits", alongside all of the comments. The sister project can be found at https://github.com/Proprixia/redditCharFreqDownloader.
The program is licensed under the GNU Public License version 3, or a later version at your option.

To operate the program, first compile it using gcc with the command "gcc -Wall -Werror main.c -l json-c -o Analyzer".
Before running the program, import a "./Downloads/" directory containing files consisting of all of the text of a Subreddit as generated by the downloader program. Each file should be named exactly like the subreddit from which its contents were taken.
In addition, create a "subreddits" text file (case sensitive) consisting of all of the subreddits you wish to analyze that are in the Out folder. At the moment, the presence of a subreddit in the text file but not the directory will cause a crash. (This will be fixed soon).
Once the Downloads directory and subreddits file are complete and in the same directory in which you are executing the program, you may execute the program and enjoy its results, which will be found in a "outputs.csv" file in the execution directory.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please contact the developer at Proprixia on GitHub.

In the future, I may add advanced configuration options, better feedback, more advanced statistics, and immunity to certain errors.
